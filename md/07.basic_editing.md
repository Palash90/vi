Basic Editing
================
Till now we have seen how to move by characters, words and
lines, go to start and end of a line, go to start of
previous, current and next lines. These consist the basic
movements.  
Now it's time to understand basics of some editing. In this
chapter we'll look into some commands which are used
for editing text. Some command may put you into 
_Insert Mode_, so be careful on what you are doing and 
if you are in confusion about the mode, press `<Esc>` key
or `Ctrl+[` (Press and hold `<Ctrl>` key and press `[` key).
This will put you back into _Normal mode_.

4.1 Insert Mode
---------------
Till this point whatever commands we have used, we used them
in normal mode. That means, whatever we have done, we did
not make any change to the actual content of the file.
We never changed the mode of vi to Insert mode or used any
command which changes any text, even if we did, we
always used `<Esc> :q!` to get out of vi, which assures that
the file you opened in vi, is left intact.  But now, we are
going to make changes to the content of the file. We have to
use Insert mode to do so.  
In Insert mode, your key hits are used as an input to file 
content and it gets stored into the buffer until you either
save or discard the changes. There are many commands to be 
used in Normal Mode to change the mode to Insert Mode. Your
key hits will be treated as an input to the file content
when you are in Insert Mode. As you read through this chapter
and the next one, you will discover them one by one.  

The first command that changes the mode of vi editor is `i`.
In Normal mode, if you press `i`, it will enter Insert
mode and whatever key you press will be treated as an input
to the buffer content and you will see the change immediately.
Let's start with an empty file, we'll add some content in
it and save it.  
```
+---------------------------------------------------------+
|$ cd ~/vi-essentials/                                    |
|$ vi                                                     |
+---------------------------------------------------------+
```
This will open the vi editor like we've seen earlier. Now
hit `i`. The editor will enter the Insert mode. Some clones
of vi will show the mode information on the last line of the
screen.  
If you press any key, they will be added to the screen in
front and will be getting stored in the buffer. It is very
common to have mode confusion at this point. If your editor
shows the mode in the last line of the screen, you are
saved. Otherwise, it is difficult understand. If you are not
seeing as you are typing, then please press `<Esc>` key or
`Ctrl+[` key combination and again hit `i` key. This will
put you in Insert Mode. Keep typing your heart's content in
it and once you are happy, go back to Normal mode by pressing
`<Esc>` or `Ctrl+[`. Make it a habit to return to Normal
Mode as soon as your typing is over.**It is always better to
leave `vi` in _Normal Mode_ when you are not typing**. If you 
forget to return to _Normal Mode_ and want to move cursor 
using movement commands, they will be taken as input to the
file content. So, make it a habit from day one to return to
_Normal Mode_ as soon as you are done with typing.   

Once you are done with typing, you have many choices. You can save the
content to a file, you can discard the content and exit or 
you can make the whole screen empty again and start fresh.
To do any of these you have to enter `ex` mode.

4.2 Ex Mode
-----------
When you are in _Normal Mode_, you simply type `:` and it
moves to ex mode and you can see cursor waiting for you in
the bottom left corner of your screen after a `:`. Now type a 
command and hit `<Enter>` key and the command gets executed.  

There are many commands you can use in ex mode but for our
current purpose, we can use either of the following -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|  Command      |   Action                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:w [file name] | This is Save Command. A new file is       |
|               | created with name 'file name' and the     |
|               | buffer content is saved in the file.      |
|               | If the file exists, it won't allow        |
|               | you to save.                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:w! [file name]| If the file exists with name 'file name', |
|               | the file is overwritten with the content  |
|               | otherwise, a new file is created. Please  |
|               | be careful while using this command. Im-  |
|               | proper use of this can loss existing data |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:q             | This is Quit command. So, it will try to  |
|               | quit the editor. But will show an error   |
|               | mentioning that the  content of the       |
|               | buffer is not saved                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:wq            | Combined Save and Quit Command. So, it    |
|               | will try to save the content but as no    |
|               | file name is mentioned, it cannot save    |
|               | the buffer content and will show similar  |
|               | error as before                           |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:wq [file name]| Combined Save and Quit Command. So, the   |
|               | content will be saved to file named 'file |
|               | name' and quit the editor.                |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:e!            | This command is issued to discard the     |
|               | changes. As we started with empty file,   | 
|               | a blank screen will be shown discarding   |
|               | all the changes.                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:q!            | Will discard the changes and exit vi      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```
According to your wish, you can either save the buffer
content to a file by using `:w [file name]` command or discard
the changes using `:q!` command or you can remove everything
and start typing fresh content by typing `:e!` command. Remember
to hit `<Enter>` key after typing the command.   

Before moving to the next section, get used to Insert Mode and
type different texts to one or more files. Also try the ex
commands mentioned in this section.

To deep dive into our next section, I chose a limerick from 
**Book of Nonsense** by _Edward Lear_. Open vi without any file
name and type the following limerick in it and save it with
the file name `limerick.txt`. In next section, we'll edit
the `limerick.txt` file.
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
           Limerick from Book of Nonsense
```

4.3 Operator Commands
---------------------
Now we know how to insert some text in a file using vi editor.
We saved a file with some text in it. Next we'll open the file
and make some changes to it using edit operators. There are some
operators you can use to change text. They are- `c`, `d`,
`y` and `p`.  

To change text, we use `c`, to delete we use `d`, to copy text
(which is known as yanking in vi), we use `y` and to put back 
the copied text, we use `p`. Operators work in conjunction 
with movement commands to make changes. The operator defines
what you want to do and the movement command defines on which 
part of the text you want the change to be made. The part of
the text to be changed is also known as a `Text Object`.
So, in a nutshell, an editing command consists of two parts,
an operator and a movement (Text Object).  

Let's try some hands-on to understand what we are talking
about.

Open the file created in section 4.2 to try editing
commands and make changes to the file.
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|$ cd vi-essentials                                   |
|$ vi limerick.txt                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
The limerick.txt file's content will be shown- 
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
### 4.3.1 Change Operator
Let's try to change the "Old Man" in the first 
line to Young Man. To do so, we have to move to the 
first line of the text and move to the word "Old". To 
do so, we need to move to the first line, we can do 
so, by using `j` and `k` commands in Normal mode. Then 
we need to move to the first character of the line, 
which we can achieve by using `0` command. Then, we 
need to move 3 words forward, that can be done using 
`3w` command, then the cursor is in the first character 
of the word Old. Now, let's change the word "Old". The
command `c` in Normal mode works to change the text. 

Remember, operators work on a movement. So, if you
think a little, you can understand that, using `c` 
operator with `w` motion will give you the exact 
result. So, to change the word "Old" we can use `cw` 
here. Once you press `cw`, the word "Old" gets copied 
into copy buffer, it gets deleted from the content 
shown on screen and the editor changes to Insert 
Mode for you to type the replacement for the word 'Old'. 
The screen looks like the following -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an _ Man on some rocks,                    |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
Now you can type the new word-
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Young_ Man on some rocks,               |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

Once you are done, you can hit `<Esc>` or `Ctrl+[` key to 
be back to normal mode.
The same way, you can use `b`, `h`, `l`, `$`, `0`, `e`, `^`,
`W`, `B`, `E` etc.  movements with the `c` command. 
Remember, c commands puts you in Insert Mode.
      
### 4.3.2 Delete Operator
The delete operator in vi editor is `d`.
`d` operator works the same way `c` operator
works, except for the fact that, it does not put you 
in Insert Mode. Let's delete the word "Young" from the
content. To do that, move the cursor to the starting 
of the word "Young" and hit `dw`. It will delete the 
word and the following space and the cursor will blink
just below the letter 'M'. The word "Young" gets copied 
into copy buffer.
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Man on some rocks,                      |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
Similar to `c` operator, `d` operator also works on `b`,
`h`, `l`, `$`,`0`,`e`,`^` etc. movements.

### 4.3.3 Yank Operator
In vi terminology, copying is known as 'yanking'.
Yanking means, copy a text for future use without
deleting the original text. To yank in vi, we use `y`
operator.
The `y` operator works like `d` operator except it does 
not delete the original text. It just copies it. Now,
let's try to copy the word "Man". The cursor now already 
blinks under Man, so, if we press `yw`, it will copy 
the word "Man" into buffer -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Man on some rocks,                      |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
Notice that, there is no change in the text. It means,
that `y` operator did not change any text, instead, it 
just copied the content into buffer. 
      
      
### 4.3.4 Put Operator
Now we know that how to copy, cut and change text. We
also know that, all the three change operators copy
the text object in a buffer (which we called as Copy 
Buffer, aka Unnamed Default Buffer). vi editor also 
allows to paste the copied text object. In vi 
terminology, this is known as 'put'. The operator to put
text back is `p`. When you type `p` in Normal mode, it 
will paste the text from buffer in the cursor location.
If you type `P`, it will paste the text from buffer on 
the left of the cursor.

Now we'll paste (put) the copied text after the word
"some", so, we'll move the cursor after the word "some" 
and press `p`. The result would be the following -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Man on some Man rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```   
If we now try to paste the same word just before the
word "Who" on the second line, we'll move the cursor to
the first of the second line by using `+` and press `P`.
The text shold look like the following -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Man on some Man rocks,                  |
|Man Who shut his Wife up in a box:                   |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```

4.4 Operator with count
-----------------------
Edit operators work on text objects (which are text based on
the cursor movement). So, if you want to delete 2 words on
the right of the cursor, you type `d2w` or to delete 2
characters on the left of cursor, you use `d2h`. Similarly it
works with `c` and `y` as well. That is the operator is 
performing an edit based on repeated motion.  

However, you can also perform repeated operations as
well. So, to delete 2 characters on the left of cursor you
can use `2dh` instead of `d2h`.
So, `d2h` and `2dh` works the same. The first combination means,
delete 2 characters on the left of the cursor while the
second one means, delete a character on the left of the
cursor 2 times. Same goes for `c` and `y` as well. So, `d2h` 
and `2dh` work same way, `3ch` and `c3h` work same way, `2yw`
and `y2w` work same way.  

You can also combine both. So, `2d3h` is also a valid change
command. This means, delete 3 characters on the left of the
cursor 2 times. So, a total 6 characters on the left from
the cursor position will be deleted. Similarly `3c2w`,
`4y3w` etc. also are valid commands.

4.5 Whole Line Editing
----------------------
In some cases, you also need to change a whole line of text,
or you need to copy a whole line and paste it back in some
other location of the file. To do this, you can move to the
line you want to change or copy, press `0` which will move the
cursor to the first of the line and press `d$`, `c$` or
`y$`. This will do the job but is a little bit of extra work.
vi editor solves this problem by using shorcut. You can move to the 
line you want to change or copy and press `cc` or `dd` or
`yy`. These commands will perform the exact same task.  

If you copied or changed or deleted a whole line using `cc`
or `dd` or `yy`, `p` operator works in a different way. If a
whole line has been copied in buffer and you use `p` command
after that, it pastes the whole line just below the current
line. If you press `P`, then the line is pasted above the
current line.

4.6 Summary
------------
These were pretty much all the basic editing staffs to be
performed in vi editor. You should practice these as much 
as possible as these form the base of using vi editor. 

For your reference, here we put another table for easy
recapitulation -
```

+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```
For saving or discrading changes, use the following ex 
commands -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
|  Command      |   Action                                  |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:w [file name] | This is Save Command. A new file is       |
|               | created with name 'file name' and the     |
|               | buffer content is saved in the file.      |
|               | If the file exists, it won't allow        |
|               | you to save.                              |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:w! [file name]| If the file exists with name 'file name', |
|               | the file is overwritten with the content  |
|               | otherwise, a new file is created. Please  |
|               | be careful while using this command. Im-  |
|               | proper use of this can loss existing data |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:q             | This is Quit command. So, it will try to  |
|               | quit the editor. But will show an error   |
|               | mentioning that the  content of the       |
|               | buffer is not saved. If there is no change|
|               | It quits the edior and returns to shell   |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:wq            | Combined Save and Quit Command. So, if vi |
|               | is opened with no file input, it will try |
|               | to save the content but as no             |
|               | file name is mentioned, it cannot save    |
|               | the buffer content and will show error.   |
|               | If vi is opened with an existing file, it |
|               | will save the changes to the file. If vi  |
|               | If vi is opened with an input as a file   |
|               | name that does not exist, the file is     |
|               | created and the content is saved into file|
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:wq [file name]| Combined Save and Quit Command. So, the   |
|               | content will be saved to file named 'file |
|               | name' and quit the editor.                |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:e!            | This command is issued to discard the     |
|               | changes. As we started with empty file,   | 
|               | a blank screen will be shown discarding   |
|               | all the changes.                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
|:q!            | Will discard the changes and exit vi      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------+
```
`p` pastes the content of buffer in the cursor location, on the
other hand `P` pastes the contents of buffer on the left of 
the cursor. If you copied whole line using `cc` or `dd` or
`yy` then `p` pastes the line from buffer below the current line and
`P` pastes the line from buffer above the current line.  

Till now we have covered all the basic movement and editing
commands. You can definitely save your day on a remote
machine connected through `ssh` using this set of commands.
Though the editing will neither be fast nor be efficient,
