vi Editor
=========
In earlier days of Unix, only text editor available was
`ed`, which still today is available in any POSIX compliant
System but it is really painful to work with ed as it is a 
line based editor. That means, it displays one
line of text at a time on the command line and allows users to make
some change and save the line to file. Struggling with the lack of a 
good text editor in UNIX, the then student of *University of 
California at Berkeley*, Bill Joy developed `ex` text editor
which was a superset of `ed` text editor. Still it was
lacking one important thing, a *visual interface*. So, he started
developing a visual interface for ex editor around 1976.
Vi editor got its name from the fact that it is a *visual
interface* to the `ex` text editor. Such a gift can be 
expected from a co-founder of _Sun Microsystems_. In spite of
the fact that, GUI has gone a long way from where it was at
1976,`vi` is still a very popular choice as a text editor. 
It is not surprising that it has made its way into the
__POSIX Standards__. While vi editor might not be intuitive and
easy for beginners, a few days of practice can make users 
edit files a lot faster and in a convenient way.

2.1 Modes in vi
---------------
vi editor is a modal editor, which means that, depending on
the mode vi editor is, commands change their course of
action. While using vi editor you don't have to move your
hands from keyboard to mouse, which is why it makes 
editing faster. Most of the commands in vi editor resides
in the typing section of your keyboard, to facilitate this vi
comes with the concept of different modes. vi offers three
modes of operation. Following are details of them -

### 2.1.1 Normal Mode
This is the mode when vi editor first opens. This mode
facilitates moving around a file and run commands which
changes the text in the file.

### 2.1.2 Insert Mode
In this mode users can type in the keyboard and text gets
inserted into the file. This behavior is similar to the one
you can expect in a Graphical Editor like Notepad or GEdit.

### 2.1.3 ex mode
vi is an extension to the text editor `ex`, so it supports
commands from ex editor as well. This mode in vi allows
the users to run ex commands. At times ex commands are far
more convenient to use than using vi commands. Also to
configure the behavior of vi editor, user need ex mode.

In the beginning, it may be pretty difficult to understand
the concept of modes and it confuses all beginners. To add
to the difficulty, there are keys which changes the mode on
the fly, changes cursor positions. So, it is confusing at
first, but as you practice, this is easy to use.

2.2 Let's get started
---------------------
After reading until this point, it can be a fair estimate
that you want your hands to get dirty on the command line.
Now is the time to do some actual stuff. To perform the
operations in this section, I would suggest you to create a
directory of your choice and navigate into it. In the
subsequent hands-on sections also, you can use this directory.
First thing we'll run on command line is `vi` command and see how
the editor looks like.
```
$ mkdir vi-essentials 
$ cd vi-essentials/  
$ vi                
```
Once you hit this command on the command prompt, depending
on the installation, you can either find a vim editor
window opened or a classic vi window opened. Following are the
two different editors' default looks -

+--------------------------------------------------------+
                     nvi editor
```
Some points to be noticed here, first is that, once you are
in, you loose access to terminal, the second point to notice
is, you see screen full of '~' (tilde) character followed by 
blank lines (except for vim, which shows some information
instead).  
Also you see some information printed on the last line.

Now, we'll cover them one by one.
 1. When you open vi it replaces your terminal - you can get
    out of vi editor by hitting `<Esc>` key and typing `:q!`.
    The `<Esc>` key puts you in normal mode. While you type
    `:` in normal mode, mode changes to ex mode and  `q` is
    the command to exit out of the vi editor, `!` is
    added to it just in case you have made some changes in
    the buffer, it will overwrite the changes and allow you
    to get back to terminal without saving anything. We'll 
    talk about these later while editing actual files.
 2. The `~` denotes that these lines are not in file. So, if
    you see the whole screen full of tilde characters
    followed by blank lines, it means the file is empty. In
    case of vim editor, instead of showing blank lines,
    it shows some information on how to get out of vim or how 
    to get help in vim. But as soon as a character is entered,
    this information is hidden. None of these are part of your
    text content.
 3. The last line shows some information. Basically, it
    shows the position of the cursor in the file like, on
    which line cursor is or on which column the cursor is
    waiting etc. The other part of information shown in the
    last line is about the file you are writing; as vi
    editor is not opened for a particular file, it opens a
    buffer.
    
You can close the vi editor by typing `<Esc> :q!`

### 2.2.1 Some Notes
1. Vi always puts you in a buffer while opening. While
   opening vi, if it was not supplied a file name, it will
   open empty buffer and when you save the content, then only 
   it gets saved in a file with a name of your choice. In
   case of editing an existing file, vi opens a buffer with
   the content from the file and when you are ready to save,
   it actually saves the changed content in the file.
2. Vi is case-sensitive. So, `q` and `Q` are two different
   commands. So, if you are experiencing an unexpected
   output, please check the `<Caps Lock>` first.

Now it's time to practice it over and over again. Once you
are comfortable getting in and out of vi editor, you can move
forward with doing some actual change in the buffer and save
to file.
