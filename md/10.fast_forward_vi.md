-----------

While using vi editor on a network streams or when a temporary buffer opens up during a command line usage of other command, it is possible that vi shows some junk characters along with the original buffer content. It confuses the user. This is a rare scenario in these days but still its possible. In such cases, you can use `Ctrl + L` key combination to redraw the screen with actual content and discards all garbage characters provided by shell.

7.2 Search
-----------

Searching withing text is very common in any type of text editing e.g. Source Code Editing, Dictation etc. Vi editor gives some search commands that you can employ to quickly navigate to the location where the search character or text is in files and you can even nvigate forward and backward with the search item.

### 7.2.1 Search for a pattern
Vi editor gives you flexibility to search for a pattern in the file. To use the feature, you need to be in Normal Mode. Press `Esc` twice to make sure you are in Normal Mode and press `/`. If you already had searched something earlier, hitting `Enter` will repeat the same search. If there was not a search pattern used earlier, you will see a message at the bottomm of your screen.  

If you want to start a new search, change to normal mode and type `/` and type the pattern you want to search and hit `Enter`, if there exists a pattern, the cursor will navigate to the start of the pattern. Otherwise, it will show a message that pattern could not be found. This command searches for the pattern in forward direction. So, it will find the next occurence of the pattern in the file. If the cursor is already at the last character of the file, then it wraps and starts the search from the start of the file.
