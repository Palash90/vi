Advanced Vi
===========

Till now we have seen many movement and editing commands in Vi editor, which will make your day to day job easier. However, there are some more commands in vi editor, that you can employ to make your life  even easier.


7.1 Redraw
-----------

Vi is a shell based editor. Which means that, the visual interface is built on top of shell. So, while using vi editor on slow shell or slow and heavy network text streams or when vi opens a temporary buffer during usage of other shell command (`git commit` is a popular example), it is possible that vi shows some junk characters along with the buffer content. It confuses the user. This is a rare scenario these days but still possible. In such cases, you can use `Ctrl + L` key combination to redraw the screen with actual content, vi discards all garbage characters introduced by shell.

7.2 Search
-----------

Searching within text is very common in text editing. Vi editor provides some search commands that you can employ to quickly navigate to the location where the search character or pattern is present and search in forward and backward direction. The search also works with Regular Expression. So, if you want to search with a particular regular expression pattern, you can use this feature. Keep in mind while searching that, vi editor search is case sensitive. So, `D` and `d` are different and yields different search results.

### 7.2.1 Search for a pattern
Vi editor gives you flexibility to search for a pattern in the file. To use this feature, you need to be in normal mode. Press `Esc` twice to make sure you are in normal mode and press `/`. If you already searched something earlier, hitting `Enter` will repeat the same search. If there was no search pattern used earlier, you will see a message at the bottomm of your screen.  


If you want to start a new search, change to normal mode and type `/` and type the pattern you want to search and hit `Enter`, if there exists a pattern, the cursor will navigate to the start of the pattern. Otherwise, it will show a message that pattern could not be found. This command searches for the pattern in forward direction. So, it will find the next occurence of the pattern in the file. If the cursor is already at the last character of the file, then it wraps and starts the search from the start of the file.   

The search works in two directions, forward and backward. To go to the next occurence of the pattern, hit `n` and to go to the previous occurence, hit `N`.  

The `/` command searches for a pattern in forward direction by default. To find previous occurence, you need `N`. To ease the process, vi editor provided `?` command which searches for a pattern in backward direction, so you will see the previous occurence of the search pattern. To see the next occurence of the patten used in `?`, you need to type `N`.  

So searching of pattern works in different ways -

`/` works in forward direction and `n` shows the next occurence of search pattern in the file.  
`/` with `N` shows the previous occurence of search pattern in the file.  
`?` works in backward direction and `n` shows the previous occurence of search pattern in the file.   
`?` with `N` shows the next occurence of search pattern in the file.  

Like hitting `Enter` immediately after typing `/` repeats the last search in the forward direction, hitting `Enter` immediately after typing `?` repeats the last search in backward direction.  

 
### 7.2.2 Search for a character in a line
Searching for a pattern is useful and you can do many of the text search using this. Vi provides another useful find command to work with characters present in line. This feature works in normal mode.  

To search for a character in a line, place your cursor on a line and type `f` followed by the character you want to search in the line. If the specified character is present in the line, it will move to the location of the character otherwise, it will stay in its position. The search happens in forward direction by default. To find a character in the line in backward direction, type `F` followed by the search character.  


The last character search can be repeated with `;` in same direction as the search happened and `,` repeats the character serach in opposite direction.   

There is another variant of the search which finds the character and places the cursor just before it. This search takes place when you type `t` followed by the search character. The `T` on the other hand places the cursor just after the previous occurence of the search character. These two search commands can also be repeated with `;` and `,` command as before.  

### 7.2.3 Move to last context

While searching is a useful feature in vi, searching here and there and returning to the last position can be daunting task to perform, especially in case of large text files. Vi provides a useful feature to handle this scenario. Vi will remember the last location of the search that it performed and you can go to that location and move back to the last edit location, to use this feature, use ``` `` ``` in normal mode. This will move between last search location and last edit location.  

 
7.3 Advanced Edits
-------------------

The basic commands cover almost all the required editing you have to do on a regular basis, however there are three more edit commands, that proves to be highly useful while doing heavy text processing.

### 7.3.1 Join Lines

This commands is useful when you have many lines and want to join them together. To use this feature, change to normal mode and move to the line you want to append and type `J`. The next line will be appended to this line.

### 7.3.2 Case Toggling

This makes more sense to programmers. At times, we misspell keywords and many of the times, it is because of Case. So, `for` becomes `For`. Or for text editing of huge texts, we may forget to capitalize the first letter of a sentence. This feature is fairly useful in these cases. To use this feature, change to normal mode and move to the location of the character you want to change its case and hit `~`. This will toggle the case of the letter.

### 7.3.3 Repeat last edit

Vi remembers the last edit action we performed and it can repeat that action. To use this feature, change to normal mode and type `.` and it will perform the last edit action.

7.4 Summary
-----------

In this chapter we saw some advance usage of vi editor. Vi editor basic commands provides a full array of edit and movement commands. These new set can help you do text processing quickly. Following is the summary of all the commands we reviewed in this chapter.

7.5 Book Summary
----------------

This book was devoted to the essential commands that a user needs while using vi editor for his day to day works. There are many commands vi editor provides. A user may not need to remember all of them, he/she may choose to use only a handful of commands that he/she is comfortable using. With time and practice, a user advances his/her vi skill and once he/she is comfortable with a set of commands, can progress for a new set of commands.  

This book just scratches the surface of using vi editor and provides all the bare essential commands to survive. There exists many clones of vi(the most popular being `Vim`). So, interested reader can contiue there learning path on vi-like editors like `Vim`, `nvi`, `elvis` or `vile`.
