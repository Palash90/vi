Some Shortcuts
=================
It is actually boring and frustrating to edit a lot of
text. While manipulating text, user can employ some shortcuts to
ease some tasks. At times, these save users from repetitive
tasks and some of them are better to there long
counterparts. In this chapter, we will discover some of
these time saving shortcuts. 

A word of caution, if you are not habituated with all the 
basic movements, change operators, and ex commands that we
covered in chapters through 2 to 4, you are strongly
recommended to go back and review them, apply them in your
day to day needs. Until those become your second nature,
you should not proceed ahead.

5.1 Undo Change
---------------
Having an option to undo a change is a life saver at times.
Let's say by mistake you deleted a whole line and you don't
know what was written in the line. If you do not know how to
undo a change, you are lost and you use `<Esc> :q!` to quit
and discard all the changes. If you have not saved your work
periodically, unfortunately you have to redo all the required
changes. Horrible idea...  
Don't worry vi editor designers may have faced the situation
and covered this scenario. They designed to use `u` as a 
command to undo the last change.  
While in Normal Mode, if you hit `u`, your last change will be
undone. Let's try this in a practical way. We will start with
a fresh copy of the limerick, we were working on chapter 4.
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
Now let's delete the third line of the limerick. You use `dd`
to do that once you are in third line by using movement
command `j` or `k`. The text in the editor looks like the
following after deletion-
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
Now hit `u` key while you are in Normal mode and the line
comes back to the original position -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
Now let's delete a word and use `u` command -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|                                                     |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
We have now deleted the word "doubt" in fourth line, we can now use
`u` command to restore it.
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
That's how you can undo your change in vi editor.  

There is also a line variation of undo command. In this
case, the editor undoes changes made to a whole line and
restores it.

For example, let's say we delete the word shut in second
line and deleted the word wife in the same line. Now if you
want to undo the change, you can only restore the word wife
but not the word shut (in vim editor you can do this by 
using multi level undo but that's out of scope of this book).
In that case, you can restore the whole line using `U` 
command. `U` command restores the whole line.

Let's try this now. Below we deleted the words shut and wife
from second line -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who his up in a box:                                 |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
We try the `u` command -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who his Wife up in a box:                            |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
This only restored the word wife but not the word shut.

Now we'll try `U` command -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
This time, to restore the whole line, `U` command was used in
Normal mode and it restored not only the last change but
also the other change made to the line.

These are the ways to undo changes in vi editor. Try them
with different changes and move on to the next section.

5.2 Replace
-----------
Now we'll talk about replacing character in a text content.
Changing a character in text content is achievable using `c`
command and movement command but replacing it in Normal mode
is a better way, you save some keystrokes and hassle of
switching between Insert mode and Normal mode. In vi editor
you can change character or even a whole word without
switching mode. To do that, there is a replace command. In
normal mode, move to the desired character and hit `r`
follwed by the replacement character. Let's change a
character in the limerick we are using -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in a box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
Let's change the character `a` in second line to `1`. To do
this, we move to the character using `h`,`j`,`k`,`l` commands and 
then press `r`, then press `1` and the character `a` gets
replaced by `1` -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in 1 box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
There is a longer version of replace also. You can use `R` to
change a sequence of characters. Keep in mind that, when you
want a longer replace, you can only change the same number
of characters, for example, you can not change character 'a'
by the word "the" because, it contains 3 characters while
'a' contains only one. Also remember, you have to move back
to Normal mode using `Ctrl+[` or `<Esc>` key after you are done
with `R` command. Let's try some hands-on with the limerick -
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in 1 box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in that box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
We'll change the last line of the limertick and replace the
word "that" to "the", now you can immediately think how we 
can do that as the two words differ in character count.
Actually we'll use a space after the word "the". That will
fill the gap of 4 characters and 3 characters. So there
we'll be two spaces before the last word in the limerick.
```
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|There was an Old Man on some rocks,                  |
|Who shut his Wife up in 1 box:                       |
|When she said, "Let me out," he exclaimed, "Without  |
|doubt                                                |
|You will pass all your life in the  box."            |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
```
Remember to hit `<Esc>` or `Ctrl+[` after you are done.

5.3 Shortcuts for deletion 
--------------------------
While replacing a character or a sequence of characters
makes editing simpler, there are still ways which makes vi
editor elegant. For example, you have to use `<Delete>`  or
`<Backspace>` keys to delete single characters in Normal mode
and Insert mode respectively, but they take a longer to 
reach than alphabets. So, vi editor uses alphabets to solve
this problem as well. You can use `dh` and `dl` to delete a 
single character. These are better still not best. Now
we'll see how we can delete character using a single key hit.
In Normal mode, you can use `x` to delete the 
character which is above the cursor. This does the same job
of `<Delete>` key. In Normal mode, you cannot use
`<Backspace>` key to delete a character. In Normal mode, 
`<Backspace>` and `h` does the same job, which is to move
the cursor one character left. To delete characters on left
of the cursor, you can use `X` in Normal mode. In Insert
Mode, you can use `<Backspace>`.
To delete until the end of a line, we use `d$`. There is
shortcut for that too. You can use `D` for the same effect.
You can remember the following table of shortcuts -
```
+--------------------------------------+ 
| Longer Version     | Shorcut         |
|--------------------------------------|
| dl                 | x               |
|--------------------------------------|
| dh                 | X               |
|--------------------------------------| 
| d$                 | D               |
+--------------------------------------+
```
Remember that, the shortcuts also can be used to work with a
count as well. So, `5x` will delete 5 characters on the right 
of cursor and `5X` will delete 5 characters on the left of 
the cursor.

5.4 Shortcuts for change
------------------------
There are shorcuts for change commands as well. For changing
a single character, you can use `s` command, which works as
`cl`. The shortcut for `c$` is `C`, which deletes until the end of
the line from cursor position and puts you in Insert mode.
The shortcut command for `cc` is `S` which deletes the whole line
and changes to Insert mode. 
You can remember the following table for change shortcuts -
```
+--------------------------------------+ 
| Longer Version     | Shorcut         |
|--------------------------------------|
| cl                 | s               |
|--------------------------------------|
| c$                 | C               |
|--------------------------------------| 
| cc                 | S               |
+--------------------------------------+ 
```
5.5 Shortcut for Save and Quit
------------------------------
While we are talking about shorcuts, this one deserves a
mention. When you want to save your changes to a file, you
need `<Esc> :wq` which is a bit of typing, You can do the same
with `<Esc> ZZ`. `ZZ` is easier to type than `:wq`.
```
+--------------------------------------+
| Longer Version     | Shorcut         |
|--------------------------------------|
| <Esc>:wq           | <Esc>ZZ         | 
+--------------------------------------+
```
5.6 Appending text
------------------
There are instances, you need to add text after the cursor.
For example, you want to add a new word in the end of a
line, how would you do that?
You move to end of line using `$`, press `i` to change to Insert
mode, then you search for the right arrow key on your key
board and start typing new characters.  

Wait, I have to use arrow keys, not a good way, isn't so?
Yes, that is not a good way. That's why vi editor comes with
concept of appending texts. Go to the end of the line using
`$`, hit `a` and the cursor moves to the right and editor is 
in Insert mode, you start typing and it appends the text to the 
line. The similar can be done to anywhere in the line, `a`
command shifts the cursor to the right and changes the editor
in Insert mode.

In some cases, you may be in between a line and want to
append text at the end of the line. You can do that by
pressing `$` which takes you to the end of the line and hit
`a` which allows you to append text. But you can still make
the process shorter, by using `A`, which works the
same way as `$a` does. 

You can also add text in the beginning of a line by using
`I` command. Which is a shortcut for `0i`.
```
+--------------------------------------+
| Longer Version     | Shorcut         |
|--------------------------------------|
| i<Right Arrow>     | a               |
|--------------------------------------|
| $i<Right Arrow>    | A               |
|--------------------------------------|
| 0i                 | I               |
+--------------------------------------+
```
5.7 New Lines 
-------------
In some cases, you may have to add a new line in between two
lines and you might also have done that while you were editing
texts in earlier sections. The usual way to do that is to
follow either - `$i→<Enter>` or `0i<Enter>`. Depending on the
command sequence used, it starts an empty line below or
above the current line and you have to move to that line
either using arrow key or using `j` or `k` command in Normal mode.
But these can be achieved in an extremely short manner with
just one key hit. Use `o` to start a blank line below the
current line and `O` to start a blank line above the current
line. The editor is automatically changed to Insert Mode.

The shortcut table for this is as follows-  
```
+----------------------------------------+
| Longer Version                | Shorcut|
|----------------------------------------|
| $i<Right Arrow><Enter><Esc>j  | o      |
|      or                       |        |
| A<Enter><Esc>j                |        |
|----------------------------------------|
| 0i<Enter><Esc>k               | O      |
|      or                       |        |
|I<Enter><Esc>k                 |        |
+----------------------------------------+
```

5.8 Summary 
-----------
In this chapter we walked through some shortcuts to some
tedious editing command combinations. We also discovered
ways to undo a change.

In next chapters, we'll talk about some advanced
movement and editing commands and also we'll talk about some
`ex` commands which make editing task convenient.
