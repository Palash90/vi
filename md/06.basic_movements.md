Basic Movement
==============
Moving around the contents of a file is the most common
thing anyone does. Once you have opened a file and want to
change its contents, you must move cursor to exact location
and perform the change. Also, movement commands form the
basis of editing commands. So, they are pretty much used 
every time you open vi.
Vi editor provides a very easy and fast way to navigate
around the file content. Well to be frank, it is not that
easy at first but after some movements, it is pretty easy.
Because the movement commands reside at your right hand home
row, the easiest location to reach on the keyboard. 

3.1 The movement commands
-------------------------
To use the movement commands, you will need to have a file
which has some text in it. So, you can copy an existing file
full of text to your working directory and try using the 
movement commands on it.
```
$ vi ~/vi-essentials/book                                 
```
### 3.1.1 Move by characters
When you open a file in vi editor, the 
cursor resides at the first character of the file. 
Press `<Esc>` key once just to make sure, you are in
normal mode.
In normal mode you can use the movement commands 
and move the cursor to your desired position.

Following are the commands to move cursor in  Normal
Mode -  
h - move cursor to the left  
j - move cursor one line down  
k - move cursor one line up  
l - move cursor to the right  

Pretty confusing (who assigns 'l' to move right), but
you should notice that all the commands are there on
your right hand home row. After some movements, this 
would be fine and it will make the most sense.

Following guide may be of use -  
h - resides on left  
j - has hook down  
k - points up  
l - is on right  

Or may be you can put a sticker on your desktop monitor
with the following print out -
```
                        k
                        ^ 
                     h<   >l
                        v 
                        j
```
Practice this movement until you don't have to think 
which key to use for which direction.

###  3.1.2 Alternatives to hjkl
All the hassles can be minimized and all confusions
can be eliminated by just using the arrow keys in
your keyboard. But think this way, it will slow you
down while editing text and it can distract you to
search for arrow keys in your keyboard while in
between a serious editing. Choice is yours but
recommendation would be to use hjkl.
Another alternative to `h` and `l` is to use
`<Backspace>` and `<Space>`. While it is true that
`<Space>` key is also easy to reach, `<Backspace>` is
not. Also, you do not get the flexibility to move
line up or down with this combination.

### 3.1.3 Move by lines
Once you are comfortable moving by characters, now
it's time to move in the line and out of the line. 
The following line level movements can be performed
in vi editor normal mode   
```
0 - move to the first character of the line
$ - move to the end of the line
^ - move to the first non-blank character of line
+ - move to first non-blank character of the next line  
<Enter> - move to first non-blank character of the next 
    line
- - move to first non-blank character of the previous 
    line
```
### 3.1.4 Move by Words
With the commands covered till now, you should be pretty 
much comfortable in moving around a file. Still something 
is missing. Perhaps, you also felt that, it would be nice 
to tap into the middle of a line or move to a particular
word and change it.
To do so, there are commands to move back and forth 
between words in vi editor.
These are the three basic word movement commands to be
used in normal mode   
```
w - cursor moves to the first character of the next word  
e - cursor moves to the last character of the  
    current/next word. If the cursor is in the last  
    character of the current word, it moves to the  
    last of the next word. Otherwise, it moves to the  
    last character of the current word  
b - cursor moves to the first character of the  
    previous/current word. If the cursor is in the  
    first character of a word, then it moves to the  
    first character of the previous word. Otherwise,  
    it moves to the first character of the current  
    word.  
```
You might have noticed that while moving, special
characters/punctuations are also treated as a single
word, so 'vi.' is actually two different words. But at
times, you may want to treat them a single word. To
do so, you just have to use capital letters of the 
command (W, E, B). Just try it out, you will understand
the difference.

Let's have a quick hands-on of these movement commands. To
do this, open vi editor with a file full of text or download
[this file](https://github.com/palash90/vi/blob/master/data.txt) and open in vi.

Move to the directory you have downloaded the file and open
using vi -  
```
$ vi data.txt                                          
```
This will open vi editor with the content of the file-  
```
In its simplest form, Data is a collection of information. 
This information may be of any type, numbers, words,       
observations, measurement or even just a description.     
                                                          
With that said, let’s dive deeper. Data can be of two      
forms,                                                     
    Qualitative – it represents description or quality of  
                  something. Analogous to Adjectives in    
                  grammars.                                
    Quantitative – it represents numerical information     
                   like 8 chairs, 9.8 meters, 20 litters   
                   etc.                                    
                                                           
Now, in a way, we can divide quantitative data into two    
parts as well,                                             
    Discrete – it has some restrictions on it. It can      
               take certain values and the values are      
               distinct and separate. This data can’t       
		be broken in smaller units.                 
               It’s typically counted in whole numbers.    
               For example: number of pages in a book,     
               gender of a person (male or female),        
		blood group of a person (A, B, O, AB) etc.  
    Continuous – it is the data that can be measured and   
                 broken down in smaller parts and still     
		  be meaningful. It is the data that can be 
		  measured on a scale and can have any      
		  value                                     
		  within a range.                           
                 For example: height of a person, length   
                 of a road, volume of a cube etc.          
```
When you first open vi, the cursor resides below the first
character of the file. In this case, it resides below the
first **I** in the file.
At this point, we'll go through the movement commands
(`h`,`j`,`k`,`l`).
First we'll try hitting `h`. As there is nothing on the left
of the character, cursor won't move anywhere.
So, now we'll try the next one which is `j`. This will bring
the cursor down one line on the second line on the first
character, that is **T**. Now we'll try hitting `k` which
will again bring back the cursor on the first line first
character, which is **I**. In short, this will bring you
back to the initial position. Now, we'll try the last one,
`l`, this will bring the cursor to the right below the
character **n**. From here, you can try hitting `h` which
will again bring you back to the initial position. Try using
these commands for a fair amount of time, until your brain
gets accustomed to it and you can automatically navigate the
cursor without thinking.  
In case, you have accidentally hit on some key which puts
you in _Insert Mode_, immediately hit `<Esc>` key or 
`<Ctrl> + [` combination to change the mode back to _Normal Mode_.  

Once you are accustomed to the basic movements, try the
other movement commands, like `0`, `$`, `+`, `<Enter>`, `^`,
`-`, `w`, `e`, `b`, `B`, `E`, `W`. Try to understand the commands by
using them on a text file with huge number of lines and they will be your second nature eventually.

3.2 Using a count
-----------------
While it is possible to traverse the whole file with these
simple commands, you can actually make the movements
extremely fast by simply putting a count in front of the
motion command. For example, if you want to move 9 lines below,
you can press `j` 9 times or you can use `9j`, the cursor
will immediately move 9 lines below. Similarly, if you need
to move 9 lines up, you can use `9k`. The same goes with other
movement commands as well. So, `2h`, `3l`, `5k`, `6w`, `6W`,
`6B`, `7b`, `8e`, `9E`, `4$`, `9+`, `8-` are also valid movements.
The  movement commands that do not work with a count is `0`
and `^`.
Also, the `$` command works with counts a bit differently. If
you press `4$`, it will move to the last of 3 lines below.
Actually, the first `$` is used to move to the
last of the current line. Then, it applies the other 3 `$`
commands to move three lines below to the end of the line.

3.3 Summary 
-----------
In this chapter we learnt a lot about moving around the file
content. So, it is better to jot them down and make a table
for future reference.

*Summary of  Movements*

|Move to the start of 6 lines below                              |  6+            |

These are pretty much all the basic movement commands, using
which you can move through a file. We'll look at other tools
for movement. But you should be pretty much comfortable with
the current set of movement commands before moving further.
As mentioned earlier, these form the basis of editing commands.
In the next chapter, we'll look into the basic editing 
commands which work in conjunction with these movement commands.
