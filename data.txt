In its simplest form, Data is a collection of information.
This information may be of any type, numbers, words,
observations, measurement or even just a description (so
pretty she is).

With that said, let’s dive deeper. Data can be of two
forms,
    Qualitative – it represents description or quality of
                  something. Analogous to Adjectives in grammars.
    Quantitative – it represents numerical information
                   like 8 chairs, 9.8 meters, 20 litters etc.

Now, in a way, we can divide quantitative data into two
parts as well,
    Discrete – it has some restrictions on it. It can
               take certain values and the values are distinct and
               separate. This data can’t be broken in smaller units. It’s
               typically counted in whole numbers.
               For example: number of pages in a book, gender of a person
               (male or female), blood group of a person (A, B, O, AB) etc.
    Continuous – it is the data that can be measured and broken down in
                 smaller parts and still be meaningful. It is the data that
		 can be measured on a scale and can have any value within a range.
                 For example: height of a person, length of a road, volume
                 of a cube etc.
